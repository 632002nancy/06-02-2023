<h2><b>Front-end vs. back-end web development</b></h2>

      <p><strong>Front-End</strong></p>
    <pre>   Once the <strong> Web Designer</strong> has put together the project’s design, the <em>Front-End Developer </em> turns drawings and concepts into reality.
        
        <i> The front end includes everything a user sees or interacts with</i>,drop-down menus to background colors and font text. This is also known as the client- <del>site</del> side.
        
        The principal coding tools of the Front-End Developer are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Still, many Front-End Developers are familiar with several other programming languages, frameworks, and libraries, including:
        <mark>Go,JavaRubyjQuery and SQLReactFlask and Django</mark>
        In short, Front-End Developers are responsible for ensuring that websites and web applications look great and work well, whether you’re using them on a phone, laptop, Mac, PC, or any browser.</pre>

            Would you move into a beautiful house if you discovered it lacked electricity, internet, or running water? While Web Designers and Front-End Developers are responsible for the look and feel of a website or web application, Back-End Developers make sure that the website is connected correctly and that you can get the information you need from the site and its servers.

            For example, when you clicked on the link to read this article, it’s because of Back-End Developers that your browser could request the article’s content, retrieve the information from our website servers, and quickly load it onto your laptop or device. This is also known as the server-side.
            
            <ins> Back-End Developers</ins> often work with <small> servers and databases</small>, which means their technical skill sets include programming languages like:
            
            PHP
            Java
            Node.js
            SQL
            Ruby
            C#
